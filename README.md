# FACT helper file

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/fkie-cad/fact_helper_file.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/fkie-cad/fact_helper_file)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/fkie-cad/fact_helper_file/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/fkie-cad/fact_helper_file)

This library offers two functions:

```python
from fact_helper_file import get_file_type_from_binary, get_file_type_from_path

get_file_type_from_binary(b'[...]')
get_file_type_from_path('/path/to/file')
```

The result is a dictionary with keys `['mime', 'full']` offering full file type string as well as mime string.

Why use? Because the library uses the extended magic library of [FACT](https://github.com/fkie-cad/FACT_core) as default before falling back on the system magic library if nothing is detected.
